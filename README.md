# ClimateConnect
Using native JavaScript(ES6) methods, implemented a set of functions and/or statements that demonstrate the following features. 
1. Given a string, provide an array of words. 
2. Given an array of words, provide an array of capitalized words from that array. 3. Given an array of words, provide an array of words that are lower case from that array. 
4. Given an array of words, provide an array of the first letter of each word from that array. 
5. Given an array of words, and a character (example: 'm'), provide an array of words that begin with that character. (case insensitive) 
6. Given an array of words, and a character (example: 't'), provide a count of the number of words from that array that begin with that character. (case sensitive) 7. Given a string, provide an object where each key is a character in the string and each value is the number of times that character (case insensitive) is present in the string. Example: “Hello there” returns 
{"h":2,"e":3,"l":2,"o":1," ":1,"t":1,"r":1} 
To demonstrate these features, use the variable sampleText provided below, and log to the console the feature numeral (A, B, C, etc), followed by the return values of each operation. 
For Example: console.log('A', wordsFromString(sampleText));
